!use xmodmap -pke > some-file to back up the current key maps
!use xmodmap -pm >> some-file to append the modifier keys to the same file. Note the output is not expressions xmodmap can execute, so one needs to comment them out.

!xmodmap:  up to 4 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

!shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
!lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
!control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x69)
!mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x6c),  Meta_L (0xcd)
!mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
!mod3      
!mod4        Super_L (0x85),  Super_R (0x86),  Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)
!mod5        ISO_Level3_Shift (0x5c),  Mode_switch (0xcb)

!seems that one needs to first clear Control and Lock before remapping keys
clear Control
clear Lock

! map ESC(9) to Caps_Lock
!keycode 9 = Caps_Lock NoSymbol Caps_Lock
! map Caps_Lock(66) to Control_L
!keycode 66 = Control_L NoSymbol Control_L
! map Control_L(37) to ESC
!keycode 37 = Escape NoSymbol Escape

keysym Escape = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
keysym Control_L = Escape

add Control = Control_L Control_R
add Lock = Caps_Lock
